This repository contains three files which contains python code for the following questions:
The file "length.py" answers the question: Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.
The file "array.py" contains the python code for the following question: Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.
The file "pal.py" contains the code for the question: You are given a string s. You can convert s to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it. Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.
Along with the above files, a PDF document is attached which explains the logic and the algorithm of the code shared along with the output snapshots.
I have executed the python code using IDLE(Python 3.10).
